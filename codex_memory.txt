# Codex Memory File
# This file stores planning notes and ideas for future development.

## Next Steps and Improvement Ideas
- Refactor core logic into classes:
  - Create `Simulation`, `Agent`, and `MemoryManager` classes for better structure and testability.
- Add comprehensive unit tests:
  - JSON parsing of protagonist responses.
  - Simulation loop outcomes and edge cases.
  - File I/O for memory and output paths.
- Implement cost and usage metrics:
  - Capture `resp.usage` from OpenAI API.
  - Calculate tokens used and estimate cost per run.
- Metrics aggregation & reporting:
  - Produce CSV or Markdown summaries of outcomes (strong/weak successes, failures).
  - Optionally generate simple HTML or Jupyter notebook visualizations.
- CLI enhancements:
  - Support dynamic role/personality profiles loaded from config files.
  - Add `--retry` and backoff policy flags for API errors.
  - Integrate Python `logging` with verbosity levels.
- Error handling improvements:
  - Graceful retries on timeouts or rate limits.
  - Clear error messages and clean shutdown.
- Packaging & distribution:
  - Add `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for installation (`pip install .`).
  - Use `__version__` in package metadata and tag releases.
- Documentation:
  - Expand `codex.md` with detailed design, flow diagrams, and example runs.
  - Add CONTRIBUTING.md and developer setup instructions.
- Continuous integration:
  - GitHub Actions to run tests, linting, and sample simulations.
  - Publish summary reports as build artifacts.
- UX & thematic touches:
  - Make dialogue playful by referencing Gabe and Dinesh from the "Silicon Valley" TV show:
    - Gabe: resourceful, a bit overconfident; Dinesh: skeptical, witty.
    - Weave light-hearted banter without being offensive.
  - Allow selectable character voices for agents (e.g., `--voice gabe`).

## Reminder
- Tomorrow, pick one major refactoring:
  either class-based decomposition or metrics/reporting integration.
- Consider humor and character voices in the next prompt templates.
